TESTING - NWSim::Packet class
==============================

Default constructed packet should have:
	ttl = 0: true
	decrementing ttl is still 0: true
	target address all zeroes: true
	source address all zeroes: true
	ID = 0: true
	data string is empty: true
	size = MINPACKETSIZE: true
	can set size to >= MINPACKETSIZE: set to 123: true
	can NOT set size to < MINPACKETSIZE: set to 0, size now: 18
Using "actual" constructor with valid data:
data = test, target = 123.123.123.123, source = 255.255.255.255, ID = 666
	ttl = 255: 255
	decrementing ttl gives 254: true
	target address matches: true
	source address matches: true
	ID matches: true
id is666should be666
	data string is test: true
	size is MINPACKETSIZE + len(test): true

==============================
TESTING - NWSim::Address helpers
==============================

Converting from int to string:
	arg 0 gives 0.0.0.0: true
	UINT32_MAX gives 255.255.255.255: true
Converting from str to int:
	0.0.0.0 = 0: true
	255.255.255.255 = UINT32_MAX: true
	Testing randomly generated (valid) address strings:: 
		Generated str '3.182.89.53' doesnt throw - : true
		Generated str '31.253.46.58' doesnt throw - : true
		Generated str '1.134.129.19' doesnt throw - : true

	invalid address "asd" throws: true
	invalid address "1" throws: true
	invalid address "255.255.255.256" throws: true
