# Evaluation for network-simulator-2

Project plan evaluation (earlier): 4

## Design

The project uses C++ mechanisms well. Documentation is very good, and object
oriented design allows for extensibility. Qt5 is used, but in rather
limited way, as described in the project documentation.

Evaluation: 4

## Working practices

Git is used well, and work distribution is well documented.
Well designed testing system exists. As the document openly discusses,
integration of Qt5 interface did not go quite as initially planned. Perhaps
the coordination among group members did not work perfectly during the
project?

Evaluation: 3

## Implementation

Implementation works robustly, and e.g. memory management seems to be
well-implemented. Qt5 has memory management issues, but it is not the
project group's fault.

Evaluation: 5

## Features

Basic simulation features have been implemented. Too bad that the
Qt5 UI did not work out as planned.

Evaluation: 3

Overall: 3.65
